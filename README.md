Hi everyone! I'm @pedrodovale. I am Software Developer, originally from Portugal.

My Github profile exists for two purposes:
* Showcase some of the things I've learned the past few years for recruitment purposes
* Provide code to the community in hope that someone finds it useful

### Tech stack

I consider myself to be a back end developer. The language I’m most proficient in is Java. I’ve explored heavily the Spring Suite: Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring JPA, Spring OAuth2 Client, and Spring OAuth2 Resource Server. These technologies were mostly applied in the implementation of REST APIs. I also have some experience with Thymeleaf, Spring Webflow, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

### Standards
In the context of implementing solutions, I’ve relied a lot on the following standards: PKCS#11, Cloud Signature Consortium API, OAuth2.0 Framework, and the draft specification DPoP which I’m currently implementing in my daily job.
